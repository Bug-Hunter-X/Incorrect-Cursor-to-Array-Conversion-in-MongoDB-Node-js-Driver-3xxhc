# Incorrect Cursor to Array Conversion in MongoDB Node.js Driver

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with MongoDB cursors in Node.js applications: incorrectly converting a cursor to an array. The `bug.js` file showcases the error, and `bugSolution.js` provides the correct solution.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file attempts to convert a MongoDB cursor to an array using a `while` loop and asynchronous `hasNext()` and `next()` methods.  This approach is inefficient and can lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets.  It also lacks proper error handling.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach using the `toArray()` method provided by the MongoDB Node.js driver.  This method is efficient, handles errors gracefully, and simplifies the code.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install the MongoDB Node.js driver: `npm install mongodb`
4. Configure your MongoDB connection string in the code.
5. Run the scripts using `node bug.js` and `node bugSolution.js` to see the difference.
